        The olfactory environment to train the agent with.
    threshold : float, optional, default=3e-6
        The olfactory sensitivity of the agent. Odor cues under this threshold will not be detected by the agent.
    name : str, optional
        A custom name to give the agent. If not provided is will be a combination of the class-name and the threshold.

        '''
        Stochastic Simulation with Random Action.
        Simulates running a single-step forward from the beliefs in the "belief_set".
        The step forward is taking assuming we are in a random state (weighted by the belief) and taking a random action leading to a state s_p and a observation o.
        From this action a and observation o we can update our belief.

            List of beliefs to expand on.
        value_function : ValueFunction
            The current value function. (NOT USED)
        max_generation : int, default=10
            The max amount of beliefs that can be added to the belief set at once.

        Returns
        -------
        belief_set_new : BeliefSet
            Union of the belief_set and the expansions of the beliefs in the belief_set.

        '''
        Main loop of the Point-Based Value Iteration algorithm.
        It consists in 2 steps, Backup and Expand.
        1. Expand: Expands the belief set base with a expansion strategy given by the parameter expand_function
        2. Backup: Updates the alpha vectors based on the current belief set

        Stochastic Search with Random Action Point-Based Value Iteration:
        - By default it performs the backup on the whole set of beliefs generated since the start. (so it full_backup=True)

        Parameters
        ----------
        expansions : int
            How many times the algorithm has to expand the belief set. (the size will be doubled every time, eg: for 5, the belief set will be of size 32)
        update_passes : int, default=1
            How many times the backup function has to be run every time the belief set is expanded.
        max_belief_growth : int, default=10
            How many beliefs can be added at every expansion step to the belief set.
        initial_belief : BeliefSet or Belief, optional
            An initial list of beliefs to start with.
        initial_value_function : ValueFunction, optional
            An initial value function to start the solving process with.
        prune_level : int, default=1
            Parameter to prune the value function further before the expand function.
        prune_interval : int, default=10
            How often to prune the value function. It is counted in number of backup iterations.
        limit_value_function_size : int, default=-1
            When the value function size crosses this threshold, a random selection of 'max_belief_growth' alpha vectors will be removed from the value function
            If set to -1, the value function can grow without bounds.
        use_gpu : bool, default=False
            Whether to use the GPU with cupy array to accelerate solving.
        gamma : float, default=0.99
            The discount factor to value immediate rewards more than long term rewards.
            The learning rate is 1/gamma.
        eps : float, default=1e-6
            The smallest allowed changed for the value function.
            Bellow the amound of change, the value function is considered converged and the value iteration process will end early.
        history_tracking_level : int, default=1
            How thorough the tracking of the solving process should be. (0: Nothing; 1: Times and sizes of belief sets and value function; 2: The actual value functions and beliefs sets)
        force : bool, default=False
            Whether to force retraining if a value function already exists for this agent.
        print_progress : bool, default=True
            Whether or not to print out the progress of the value iteration process.
        print_stats : bool, default=True
            Whether or not to print out statistics at the end of the training run.

        Returns
        -------
        solver_history : SolverHistory
            The history of the solving process with some plotting options.
