class SimulationHistory:
    '''
    Class to record the steps that happened during a simulation with the following information being saved:

    - the positions the agents pass by
    - the actions the agents take
    - the observations the agents receive ('observations')
    - the time in the simulation process


    Parameters
    ----------
    start_points : np.ndarray
        The initial points of the agents in the simulation.
    environment : Environment
        The environment on which the simulation is run (can be different from the one associated with the agent).
    agent : Agent
        The agent used in the simulation.
    time_shift : np.ndarray
        An array of time shifts in the simulation data.
    horizon : int
        The horizon of the simulation. i.e. how many steps can be taken by the agent during the simulation before he is considered lost.
    reward_discount : float, default=0.99
        A discount to be applied to the rewards received by the agent. (eg: reward of 1 received at time n would be: 1 * reward_discount^n)

    Function to run n simulations for a given agent in its environment (or a given modified environment).
    The simulations start either from random start points or provided trough the start_points parameter.
    The simulation can have shifted initial times (in the olfactory simulation).

    The simulation will run for at most 'horizon' steps, after which the simulations will be considered failed.

    Some statistics can be printed at end of the simulation with the 'print_stats' parameter.
    It will print some performance statisitcs about the simulations such as the average discounter reward.
    The reward discount can be set by the 'reward_discount' parameter.

    To speedup the simulations, it can be run on the gpu by toggling the 'use_gpu' parameter.
    This will have the consequence to send the various arrays to the gpu memory.
    This will only work if the agent has the support for to work with cupy arrays.

    This method returns a SimulationHistory object that saves all the positions the agent went through,
    the actions the agent took, and the observation the agent received.
    It also provides the possibility the save the results to a csv file and plot the various trajectories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    agent : Agent
        The agent to be tested
    n : int, optional
        How many simulation to run in parallel.
        n is optional but it needs to match with what is provided in start_points.
    start_points : np.ndarray, optional
        The starting points of the simulation in 2d space.
        If not provided, n random points will be generated based on the start probabilities of the environment.
        Else, the amount of start_points need to match to n, if it is provided.
    environment : Environment, optional
        The environment to run the simulations in.
        By default, the environment linked to the agent will used.
        This parameter is intended if the environment needs to be modified compared to environment the agent was trained on.
    time_shift : int or np.ndarray, default=0
        The time at which to start the olfactory simulation array.
        It can be either a single value, or n values.
    time_loop : bool, default=True
        Whether to loop the time if reaching the end. (starts back at 0)
    horizon : int, default=1000
        The amount of steps to run the simulation for before killing the remaining simulations.
    initialization_values : dict, default={}
        In the case the agent is to be initialized with custom values,
        the paramaters to be passed on the initialize_state function can be set here.
    reward_discount : float, default=0.99
        How much a given reward is discounted based on how long it took to get it.
        It is purely used to compute the Average Discount Reward (ADR) after the simulation.
    print_progress : bool, default=True
        Whether to show a progress bar of what step the simulations are at.
    print_stats : bool, default=True
        Whether to print the stats at the end of the run.
    print_warning : bool, default=True
        Whether to print warnings when they occur or not.
    use_gpu : bool, default=False
        Whether to run the simulations on the GPU or not.
    batches : int, default=-1
        In how many batches the simulations should be run.
        This is useful in the case there are too many simulations and the memory can fill up.
        The value of batches=-1 will make it that different batches amount are tried in increasing order if a MemoryError is encountered.

    Returns
    -------
    hist : SimulationHistory
        A SimulationHistory object that tracked all the positions, actions and observations.
